Overview of the script:
Reads CIF files from an input folder or uses a precomputed similarity matrix.
Optionally strips terminal atoms (except S, O, N) from molecular structures to focus on core frameworks.
Computes packing similarity between all pairs of structures using CCDCâ€™s PackingSimilarity tool.
Builds a similarity matrix based on the number of matched molecules or RMSD (root-mean-square deviation).
Visualizes the matrix as a heatmap with labeled axes.
Saves outputs: The similarity matrix as a text file, the heatmap as a PNG, and optionally detailed packing similarity results (text file and MOL2 overlays).
It leverages numpy for matrix operations, matplotlib for plotting, and ccdc for crystallographic functionality, with a command-line interface for configuration.
